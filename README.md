# **COVID-19 Mortality Predictor using Biomarkers and Machine Learning**
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive project aimed at predicting COVID-19 mortality based on biomarkers using advanced machine learning techniques. The project involves an in-depth analysis of patient data, comprising both survivors and non-survivors of the coronavirus. The dataset underwent meticulous preprocessing and was further explored in two distinct variations: the original dataset and a scaled version. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to both datasets, resulting in four distinct versions: original dataset, original dataset with PCA, scaled dataset, and scaled dataset with PCA.

The project delves into the application of various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Logistic Regression. Different strategies, such as subsampling and oversampling, were also experimented with to enhance model performance. The entire workflow includes rigorous cross-validation procedures and the computation of a diverse range of accuracy metrics. These metrics were utilized to assess model performance, and confusion matrices were employed to gain insights into classification results.
